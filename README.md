# bimswarm-api
The BIMSWARM API enables interaction with individual process chains with user-related construction IT product combinations, which are referred to as 'toolchains'. Toolchains can be preconfigured via the composer on the BIMSWARM platform and subsequently used again and again. Corresponding API routes are specified for the use of toolchains created in the Composer in external applications in interaction with an openCDE-compliant data store in openAPI. For further information, please visit www.bimswarm.de
